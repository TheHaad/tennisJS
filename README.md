Tennis game created with JS and Canvas

Purpose:
I completed this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/code-your-first-game/
by Chris De Leon.

It is a great back to basics kind of course.

I want to get back to my roots. When I decided that computer science was going to be my major,
I had one intent in mind: develop video games.

Life has a way changing plans.
I've sat on this course for years. I decided to look at it again as a reminder as to why I became
a software developer.

This was my first steps into reconnecting with myself. Based on this course, I'm going to explore
additional courses related to game development.
